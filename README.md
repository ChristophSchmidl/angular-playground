# Angular-Playground

This repository merely serves the purpose of learning Angular (v2/v4). I will document all steps during the learning process which I find worthy to write down.

## Installing the Angular CLI

The Angular CLI will make your life much simpler if you want to develop Angular applications. It has a variety of useful commands built right into it. You can find the official documentation of the Angular CLI right here: https://cli.angular.io/

To install the Angular CLI:
* ``` npm install -g @angular/cli  ```

Generating and serving an Angular project via a development server Create and run a new project:
* ```
	ng new my-project
	cd new-project
	ng serve

Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
